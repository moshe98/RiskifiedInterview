# Welcome to C# boilerplate!

If you've decided to write your simulation in C# we just wanted to tell you that you rock!

This boilerplate holds the very basic .NET WebAPI server for you to be able to complete your simulation successfully.

### Running the server

In order to run the server, you should just run the project from your Visual Studio.

This will start the server on port **8000**.

If everything works fine you should be able to access the `/healthcheck` endpoint and receive the following response:

### Mock server

As part of the simulation there is a mock server that you will have to work against. In order to make sure things are as smooth as possible we've made sure that upon accessing the `/healthcheck` endpoint we're also checking whether the mock server is accessible. If it fails please **contact your interviewer ASAP**.

**Good luck!**
